"""
Module for playing a FrozenLake episode using a trained Q-table.
This module contains the function 'play' that makes the trained agent play
an episode by always exploiting the Q-table. Each board state is rendered
(using render_mode="ansi") and stored in a list. Note: Ensure that the
environment is created with render_mode="ansi".
