def pool_forward(A_prev, kernel_shape, stride=(1, 1), mode='max'):
    """
    Performs forward propagation for a pooling layer.

    Args:
    A_prev (numpy.ndarray):
        Input data of shape (m, h_prev, w_prev, c_prev) where:
        - m is the number of examples,
        - h_prev is the height of the previous layer,
        - w_prev is the width of the previous layer,
        - c_prev is the number of channels in the previous layer.

    kernel_shape (tuple):
        Size of the pooling kernel, as (kh, kw) where:
        - kh is the kernel height,
        - kw is the kernel width.

    stride (tuple, optional):
        Stride of the pooling operation, as (stride_height, stride_width).
        Default is (1, 1).

    mode (str, optional):
        Pooling mode to use, either 'max' for max pooling or 'avg'
        for average pooling.
        Default is 'max'.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray:
        Output of the pooling layer, of shape (m, n_h, n_w, c_prev) where:
        - n_h is the height of the output,
        - n_w is the width of the output,
        - c_prev is the number of channels (same as input channels).
